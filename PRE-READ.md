# Pre-read: Coding Interview Preparation

Congratulations on being shortlisted! This document will help you prepare for the upcoming coding interview round.

## Interview Format

The interview process consists of two phases:

### Phase 1: Coding Round
- **Duration**: 90 minutes
- **Type**: Hands-on coding session
- **Format**: You'll be given a problem statement at the start
- **Goal**: Build a working application based on the problem shared

### Phase 2: Explanation Interview
- **Duration**: 30 minutes (if selected)
- **Type**: Technical discussion
- **Format**: You'll be asked to explain your solution, design decisions, and code logic
- **Focus**: Demonstrate your understanding of the code and your problem-solving approach

## What to Expect

### During the Coding Round (90 minutes):

1. **Problem Statement**: You'll receive a problem statement at the beginning
2. **Development Time**: You'll have 90 minutes to design, build, and test your solution
3. **Live Coding**: You'll be building the application in real-time
4. **Submission**: Submit your code via GitHub repository as per the instructions

### After the Coding Round:

Selected candidates will be invited for a 30-minute explanation interview where you'll:
- Demonstrate your working application
- Explain your design decisions and approach
- Discuss your code logic and implementation choices
- Answer questions about your solution

## Prerequisites & Preparation

### Technical Setup

Before the interview, ensure you have:

1. **Development Environment Ready**:
   - Your preferred IDE/editor installed and configured
   - Git installed and configured
   - A GitHub account set up and ready to use
   - Terminal/command line access

2. **Technology Stack** (Choose what you're comfortable with):
   - **Programming Language**: Python or Java
   - **Backend Framework**: 
     - For Python: Flask, FastAPI, Django, etc.
     - For Java: Spring Boot, etc.
   - **Database**: Any database of your choice (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)

3. **GitHub Repository**:
   - Know how to create a new repository on GitHub
   - Understand how to add collaborators to a private repository
   - Be familiar with basic Git commands (add, commit, push)


## What You Can Use

- ✅ **LLMs/AI Coding Assistants**: You are **allowed** to use any LLM or AI coding assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini Code Assist, Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- ✅ **Internet**: Feel free to search for documentation, examples, or solutions
- ✅ **Any Resources**: Use any tools, libraries, or frameworks that help you build the solution


## Interview Day Checklist

- [ ] Development environment is set up and working
- [ ] GitHub account is ready
- [ ] You have a stable internet connection
- [ ] Your IDE/editor is open and ready
- [ ] Terminal/command line is accessible
- [ ] You're in a quiet, distraction-free environment
- [ ] You have a way to demo your application (screen sharing ready)

## Tips for Success

### During the Coding Round:

1. **Read Carefully**: Take time to understand the problem requirements fully
2. **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to ask for clarifications if needed
3. **Start Simple**: Build a working solution first, then enhance if time permits
4. **Test as You Go**: Verify your code works at each step
5. **Document Your Decisions**: Make notes about why you made certain design choices (this will help if you're invited for the explanation interview)
6. **Stay Calm**: 90 minutes is sufficient time - focus on building a working solution

### If Invited for Explanation Interview:

1. **Review Your Code**: Go through your solution before the interview
2. **Prepare to Explain**: Be ready to walk through your code and explain your approach
3. **Think About Alternatives**: Consider what you might have done differently and why
4. **Be Honest**: If you used LLMs, be prepared to explain what you learned and how you adapted the code

## What NOT to Worry About

- ❌ Perfect code - focus on working, readable code
- ❌ Using the "best" framework - use what you're comfortable with
- ❌ Advanced features - a simple, working solution is better than incomplete complexity
- ❌ Making mistakes - we understand you're working under time pressure

## Next Steps

1. Review this document and ensure you meet all prerequisites
2. Set up your development environment if you haven't already
3. Prepare your GitHub account
4. Be ready for the coding round with a positive mindset
5. After submission, stay available in case you're selected for the explanation interview
